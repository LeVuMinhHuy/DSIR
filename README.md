##### FAQs:
- Why data structure ?  
Because i'm suck of data structures (too lazy while i was at uni)

- Why this list ?  
Inspired by one of [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)' streams on Twitch, which he implemented these in TS ([this stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1546395342?filter=archives&sort=time))

- Why Rust ?  
Because Rust is the best (stackoverflow said that)

- The progress ?  
Code a bit every morning (i hope)
